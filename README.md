# Telescope
Computes various quantities of a Telescope containing several antennae.

Run ```IRIS.py``` from command line.
For example, to compute the baseline length between two antennae, use the following:

```venv\Scripts\python.exe IRIS.py baseline_between --file telescope.json```

Ensuring the working directory contains the relevant files with nested ```python.exe```.
